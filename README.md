       <p style="font-size:130%;">This Google course taught me the essential skills needed to start a career in data analytics. It consisted of 8 individual certificates, paced to be 5 weeks each on average. The first certificate covered data basics. The middle course covered the data analytics steps of ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. The final certificate involved putting all of the data analytics skills to the test with a case study on a dataset of my choice. Some of the skills involved in the course included asking smart business questions, data cleaning, analyzing data in spreadsheets and SQL, visualizing data in Tableau, using the programming language R, and sharing insights to make data-driven business decisions.<br><br></p>

        <p style="font-size:130%;">I began my undergraduate degree in the biology major, a reflection of my love for physical sciences. After taking an introduction to psychology course, I discovered a new passion and pursued the psychology degree. I'm very glad that I had the opportunity to devote years to the study of psychology.
          I am grateful to have gained an education in a field that is so informative and diverse. During my studies, I gained a greater appreciation of the complexities and diversity, as well as universalities, of the human experience. I grew to love reading the academic literature, especially meta analyses on various topics. I learned new technical writing skills. I became skilled at statistics, as well as research design and analysis. I gained a deep understanding of the brain and the functions it orchestrates. I learned, above all, that I am capable of learning anything I put my mind to.<br><br></p>

           <p style="font-size:130%;">I am thankful to have received a high-quality well-rounded primary education. Aside from the required curriculum, I also elected to take 4 AP courses during high school (in biology, English, literature, and environmental science). I received a 4, 5, 4, and 5 on those AP tests respectively. During my high school education, I excelled in mathematics, English, and the physical sciences. My GPA in high school was 3.971. My transcript featured a single B, rightfully awarded for my performance in Geometry, a high school class I took during middle school. Earning that B taught me the valuable lesson that I can only learn as much as I'm willing to ask questions. I applied that lesson throughout the rest of my education by asking questions whenever I didn't understand something. Over time, I've come to believe that I can learn anything I want if I'm given enough time and if I ask questions and seek answers. <br><br>
          Aside from academics, I was quite busy with extracurriculars during high school. I attended a 1-hour morning study at my church every schoolday during all 4 years of high school. I also participated in cross country, swimming, soccer, and track & field. I was a competitive athlete and a leader on these teams. By the time I graduated, I had acheived my ambitious goal as a runner, which was to graduate with the school records in the 800 meter, 1600 meter, 3200 meter, and 5000 meter races. My time in high school helped me learn to set and acheive goals through hard work and discipline.</p>
